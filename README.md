# Book App

This is a serverless project developed with the objective of consuming data sent by an API of a CMS. The Frontend was developed using ChakraUI and the icons provided by Phosphor Icons. 

Some technologies such as React Router Dom and ContextAPI were used to make the application closer to a real development. The ContextAPI manipulates book data for all pages, thus allowing the consumption of this data. React Router Dom controls application routes.
